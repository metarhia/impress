**Enterprise** application server for **[Node.js](http://nodejs.org)**: secure,
lightweight, interactive, and scalable.

## Description

**First** Node.js server scaled with **multithreading** and extra thin workload
**isolation**. Optimized for **high-intensive** data exchange, rapid development,
and **clean architecture**. Provides everything you need out of the box for
**reliable** and **efficient backend**, network communication with web and mobile
clients, protocol-agnostic **API**, run-time type validation, real-time and
in-memory data processing, and **reliable stateful** services.

**Weak sides**: not a good choice for content publishing including blogs and
online stores, server-side rendering, serving static content and stateless
services.

**Strong sides**: security and architecture for enterprise-level applications,
long-lived connections over websocket to minimize overhead for cryptographic
handshake, no third-party dependencies.

## Quick start

- See project template: [metarhia/Example](https://github.com/metarhia/Example)
- Start server with `node server.js`
- See [documentation and specifications](https://github.com/metarhia/Contracts)

API endpoint example: `application/api/example.1/citiesByCountry.js`

```js
async ({ countryId }) => {
  const fields = ['cityId', 'name'];
  const where = { countryId };
  const data = await db.select('City', fields, where);
  return { result: 'success', data };
};
```

You can call it from client-side:

```js
const res = await metacom.api.example.citiesByCountry({ countryId: 3 });
```

## Metarhia and impress application server way

- Applied code needs to be simple and secure, so we use sandboxing with v8
  isolated contexts, worker threads and javascript closures;
- Domain code should be separated from system code; so we use DDD, layered
  (onion) architecture, DI, SOLID and GRASP principles, contract-based approach;
- Impress supports stateful applications with RPC and client-session sticky to
  servers; microservices, centralized or distributed architecture;
- No I/O is faster even than async I/O, so we hold state in memory, share it
  among multiple threads and use lazy I/O for persistent storage;
- We use just internal trusted dependencies, no third-party npm packages;
  total Metarhia technology stack size is less than 2mb.

## Features

- **API auto-routing** calls to `endpoint` for rapid API development (no need to add routes manually)
- **API concurrency**: request execution timeout and execution queue with both timeout and size limitations
- **Schemas** for API contract, data structures validation, and domain models
- **Application server** supports different API styles: RPC over AJAX and over Websocket, REST, and web hooks
- **Multiple protocols** support: HTTP, HTTPS, WS, WSS
- **Auto loader** with `start` hooks, namespace generation for code and dependencies
- **Live reload** of code through filesystem watch
- **Graceful shutdown** with `stop` hooks
- **Minimal dependencies** and reduced code size
- **Layered architecture**: api, domain logic, data access layer, and system code layer (hidden)
- **Code sandboxing** for enhanced security and execution context isolation
- **Code protection**: reference pollution prevention, prototype pollution prevention
- **Multi-threading** for CPU utilization and execution isolation
- **Load balancing** for simple scaling with redirection to multiple ports
- **Caching**: in-memory caching for APIs and static files
- **Configuration**: environment-specific application settings
- **Database access** layer compatible with PostgreSQL with SQL-injection protection
- **Persistent sessions** with authentication, groups, and anonymous sessions
- **Buffered logging** (lazy write) with log rotation (keep logs N days) and console interface
- **Testing**: integrated node.js native test runner and table-test support
- **Inter-process** communication and shared memory used for state management
- **File utilities**: upload, download, support for partial content and streaming
- **Task Management**: scheduled task execution at specific intervals or certain times

## TODO list

Those features will be implemented in nearest future (3-6 months):

- Server health monitoring
- Database migrations
- State synchronization mechanism with transactions and subscription
- Multi-tenancy support

## Requirements

- Node.js v18.x or v20.x
- Linux (tested on Fedora v36-38, Ubuntu v18-23, CentOS v8-9)
- Postgresql v11-16
- OpenSSL v3 or later (optional, for https & wss)
- [certbot](https://github.com/certbot/certbot) (recommended but optional)
